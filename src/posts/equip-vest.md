Decaf ventis and Quake 3 Arena \
Man-whoring yourself on social media \
Cheap dopamine to replace previous vices \
An aviary and bowling all by yourself \
It was a blast so why bother trying? \
You are way better off alone \
Duh? 

It helps to deny, doesn’t it? \
Gun to your head, tell them you’re doing great \
No need for appreciation  \
Or to be checked up on \
Four attempts to explain the thriller \
But you always get talked over \
What’s new? 

Involuntarily sneaking in mini crying sessions \
As part of your morning routine \
Guess that’s just part of life now \
It’s okay to scream irrational statements \
To lack the capacity to be understanding \
Remember that you are human  \
And you have been pushed. 

You feel like you always get talked over \
You try to rationalize it \
You end up gaslighting yourself  

Trying to talk about yourself  \
They just make it about them  \
You try to rationalize it \
You end up gaslighting yourself  

Unsolicited advice \
You just need to be listened to \
You try to rationalize it \
You end up gaslighting yourself  

You are capable of deep love and kindness \
Which means you’re also capable of the opposite  \
Isn’t that terrifying? \
Please remember: \
You are human. \
You have been pushed. \
It is valid to feel this way.
