*Medium close-up shot of a young adult white male, dark brown hair and no facial hair, looking serious with a hint of anxiety, and if someone pointed it out, he does look insecure. He’s wearing a shirt with the big words „PARKOUR IS LIFE“. A white dirty background being the wall of his basement in his student housing.*

NEIL: Hey everyone. For this assignment, I’ve chosen my topic to be about data science. [Right away, you notice the anxiety in his voice and the stiffness in his figure] According to chief economist at Google and UC Berkeley professor Hal Varian, data science is the ability to take data, be able to understand it, ummm.. Sorry can we start over?

*A voice from behind the camera, the cameraman.*

DAN: Why man? You're doing well. Keep going!

NEIL: *big sigh* No man, that was terrible. *his expression displays defeat, he’s looking down, he rubs his nose with the side of his index finger to cover his face, feeling exposed to the camera, feeling vulnerable. A light brown wooden bracelet can be seen around his right hand.* 

DAN: Neil, man! You’re doing fine. You just need to be more confident in yourself. This is due in like two weeks, right? 

NEIL: Three.

DAN: Three weeks. You have a lot of time, dude!

NEIL: Dan can we please just start over? Please.

CUT.
*Same scene as previous. Re-do.*
 
NEIL: Hey everyone. I’m going to be talking about data science. According to chief economist at Google and also UC Berkeley professor Hal Varian, data science is the ability to take data, be able to understand it, process it, extract value out of it, visualize it, and communicate it.

CUT.

*A basement room with a low ceiling and yellow walls with some hints of brown due to ripping of posters by previous tenants. The shot is like a Skype/Zoom video call from the laptop.*

NEIL: Data scientists need to be curious and result-oriented, with industry-specific knowledge and technical skills, as well as communication skills to explain their technical findings to their non-technical colleagues. The types of tools that a data scientist uses are R, Python, ummm Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, NoSQL, D3, Tableau, iPython notebooks. As you can probably tell, it is a wide range of tools. You have the programming languages and the data visualization tools and the databases.... Umm.. *mumbling, barely audible* I’ll do the rest of this tomorrow.

CUT.

*Same scene as last, but Neil is wearing different clothes, indicating that a few days has passed*

NEIL: Some examples of applications of data science are predicting flight delays of certain airlines, predicting diseases based on biological data, self-driving cars, fraud and risk detection, and many more. As you can see, data science encompasses a wide range of use cases and disciplines. There are many interdisciplinary..

*Neil’s phone rings. Neil stops talking and answers it*

NEIL: Yes, Mom? I’m making a video for school right now....... It’s for my databases class....... No I’m not continuing German this year..... Okay, maybe. Read it out, I’ll see if I can translate it.......... I think it says „Some things will come when you stop searching for them so hard.“.... I think..... Where is that from? ...... Okay, that makes sense, I think that's what it means..... Mom you know you can just Google translate this, right?...... Okay okay that's fine.... Okay mom I have to go now, I really have to make this video, it's due next week, I have so much to do. Bye!... Yup, bye!

CUT.

*It’s a backyard at dawn, about 7pm, sun is just setting, and it’s dark sky blue outside. Neil sits on a patio bench. It’s a medium shot slightly high, as if the shot was from the POV of a person standing north-east facing Neil. He’s wearing a light grey hoodie, adidas track pants, puma shoes. His hoodie sleeves are rolled up and you can see his wooden bracelet.*

NEIL: There are different types of careers with data science. For example, data scientist. Data scientists look at unstructured data, mostly from businesses, and try to find the questions that need answering. Tools needed for this are SAS, R, Python, Hadoop, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization. Another possible job with data science is data analyst. A data analyst bridges the gap between data scientists and business analysts. They take the questions that need answering and then organize the data and try to find results that align with business needs. Their set of skills are pretty similar to data scientists. Another job is data engineer. *Dan (the cameraman)’s phone starts ringing.* A data engineer -

DAN: Sorry Neil, I gotta take this. Hello?

*Dan turns to his left, turning the camera to the left and then facing downwards to the wooden deck that they're on.*

DAN: Oh shit. I thought he was still in Stockton for the conference? Doesn’t it end- oh damn! Alright. He leaves later tonight? Shit. Why didn’t he text or call me then? Oh okay. Okay. Yeah, I can be there in thirty minutes. I’ll see you soon.

*Footsteps can be heard behind Dan, he moves around a bit* 

DAN: Hey Neil. I’m sorry man.

*Dan, sounding genuinely apologetic, puts the camera down the deck floor, revealing Neil’s back. Neil is sitting on the edge of the deck, feet on the grass, slouched in defeat and frustration. His face buried in his hands. Dan runs from the camera, joins to sit beside Neil. They both have their backs turned to the camera now.*

*The audio isn't the best so subtitles are used here.*

DAN: My brother is in town until later tonight for work and I haven't seen him in months, and it's just been busy for me in the lab and all, so I won’t get to see him after this because he's leaving again really soon, to Phoenix. For a conference.

*Neil, almost whispering,*

NEIL: It’s okay. It’s not your fault. I’m just really overwhelmed.

DAN: When's it due and how much left do you have to do?

NEIL: Due in two days. I have a lot left, man. I don’t even fucking know how to edit a video or work the camera. I don't even know.. why I’m doing this assignment, it's so fucking stupid. It's a programming class not a fucking media.. creative arts class. Fucking hate being on camera.

DAN: You seem like you're doing fine. You don't seem anxious at all.

NEIL: No man, it's really stressful. I just haven’t felt good lately. I haven’t made a single friend since this year started. I only have this one year left and I spent the last few years focused on studying, hermiting. It’s been two months, man.

DAN: Well, how about Bruce? Are you guys.. still in touch?

NEIL: I don’t think I exist to him anymore. Ever since he moved to fucking Vancouver with Stacy...... I mean I’m happy for him, but he has a new friend group now....... They’re in commerce and just as outgoing as him and not so fucked up and pathetic...... He doesn't even do parkour anymore. I’m too scared to ask him if he still..... wears his bracelet. We agreed that we’d be really amazing at parkour by the end of university and still be really good friends who’ve like... grown with each other. And this bracelet was supposed to be a symbol for that.

DAN: Do you guys still talk?

NEIL: He hasn’t replied to my last messages so I stopped messaging him. Two months ago.

DAN: Damn. Neil, man... That sounds rough.

*The background noise intensifies, just to make this seem more real.*

NEIL: It’s just so fucking sad. We get four years to be in an environment with people close to our age, where we’re studying what we choose, where there's so many events and things to do, and yet I’m completely alone. After this, we’re gonna be...... in that 9-5 real world environment.... where people are less friendly and.... less open-minded. I can’t fucking study in libraries or coffee shops anymore because I look around and see people being happy together... overhearing their deep and fun conversations.... makes me want to break down, man. How do people make friends just like that? How does that even begin to happen? How does it play out? Fuck.

DAN: You just have to keep putting yourself out there and hope for the best. You have nothing to lose being vulnerable, man.

NEIL: But it's terrifying..

DAN: Then I’d start small. Whatever that means for you. I’d take time to find out..... what I’m comfortable with and..... what I still.... need more time for. It could mean asking someone in class if the seat beside them is taken and maybe making a comment about the assignment... or asking how it is. Soon enough, you’ll make a connection.

*Neil appears as if he's not even listening, lost in his own sadness, but Dan continues speaking.*

DAN: And maybe it’ll escalate to something better like a coffee hang-out.. or a study hang-out. You just have to keep putting yourself out there.... You’re a great guy, Neil. I’m glad to have you as my housemate.

NEIL: Thanks.

DAN: Did you do parkour today?

NEIL: Yeah. Same route.

DAN: Monkey playground by Cootes?

NEIL: Yeah.

DAN: Nice. It’s a beautiful place isn’t it?

NEIL: Yeah, man. Big grass surrounding the area and you can feel the strong breeze of the wind. Makes me feel.. it just makes me feel.

DAN: That's great, man. Well, I gotta go. Take care of yourself, alright? Chin up.

NEIL: Okay. Bye Dan.

DAN: Later, man.

*Dan gets up and walks away. He disappears. Neil waits about ten seconds until he gets up and walks to the camera, turning it off.*

CUT.

*Neil is holding the camera towards himself, he’s in a big open field. It's almost sunset. He's sweating in track clothes, slightly out of breath.*

NEIL: A data engineer simply transforms data into a useful format for analysis. They prepare the big data infrastructure for data scientists to analyze.

CUT.

*Outside MUSC entrance, walking away from the building, Neil is recording himself. The camerawork is rough, fumbling up and down as Neil walks.*

Neil: So if you’re analytical, if you love connecting the dots, have solid knowledge of math and stats, good at visualization, and also able to communicate very technical ideas to non-technical colleagues, then data science might be the career for you! You will be working on important things that will make an impact on the world. And furthermore, data scientists make a great..

*A woman voice from behind interrupts Neil.* 

WOMAN: Hey. Sorry.

NEIL: ..salary.

WOMAN: Excuse me!

*Neil notices on the camera, a red-headed woman behind him calling for him. He turns around towards her, the camera facing to the sky and the bottom of his chin.*

WOMAN: You do parkour at Nero Park, right?

NEIL: Uhhh...

WOMAN: Sorry, I must’ve gotten you confused for someone else.

NEIL: Wait. Are you talking about the playground with the big field.. with the fancy monkey bars?

WOMAN: Yes!

NEIL: Oh sorry, I didn't know it was called Nero Park. Yes, I do.

WOMAN: Ah, I knew I wasn’t crazy. Anyway, sorry. I hope this isn't weird. I jog around that area and I see you doing parkour often. I do acrobatics and I’m getting into gymnastics. I’m trying to learn an aerial. I've seen you do them before and you do them really well. Maybe you can give me a few tips sometime?

NEIL: Umm... Yeah, sure. Can you do a cartwheel?
WOMAN: Yes.

NEIL: How about a one-handed cartwheel?
WOMAN: Kind of.

NEIL: Okay. It’s basically a cartwheel but really fast. You have to.. It's better if I show you. Ummm...

WOMAN: Okay. I’ll jog around tomorrow at the same time and I’ll meet you there then. I-mean-if-you’re-okay-with- that... Does that work? I don't want to.. intrude, or anything.

NEIL: Uhh..

WOMAN: Sorry if this is too straight-forward. To be honest, I’m finding it pretty hard to make friends in university.

NEIL: No it's okay. Tomorrow works. I was just thinking if I’d be doing parkour tomorrow or if I’d be lifting weights. But tomorrow I’m doing parkour, I’ll be there!

WOMAN: Great!

NEIL: Okay. Sounds good. I guess I’ll see you then.

WOMAN: Okay. I’m Beth, by the way!

NEIL: I’m Neil.

BETH: Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow.

NEIL: Okay, bye!

*Footsteps walking away can be heard. Neil just stands still there, comprehending what the fuck just happened, and this takes a few seconds. Then he does a half-laugh half-sigh, out of relief. Then he laughs. He feels as if the universe just gave him a big break. He looks at the camera smiling, puzzled but excited, freezes for a second, and then turns it off.*
