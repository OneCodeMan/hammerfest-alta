(They’re in a backyard, two patio chairs and a table in between)

D: What’s going on, man? Nice to have you here. I’ve been
spending the past few weeks here alone. Completely alone.

E: Nice to be here. What have you been up to lately?

D: The usual. Programming and language learning. And you?

E: The usual too. Overthinking and random existential crises. Sometimes crying.

D: Aw..

E: Just kidding. I’ve been working on my grip.

D: I see. For climbing?

E: No, no. My grip on life, on my thoughts and my emotions.

D: That’s so nice to hear! You got this.

E: Thanks. Beautiful weather, eh?

*CUT*

LR: Beautiful weather, eh?

Ody: Yeah. You look classy. I’m Ody. Nice to meet you.

LR: Good day. You look.. colourful. I’m Laughthaniel Riot.

Ody: What a long name!

LR: Hahaha. You don’t have to call me that. It’s Riot for short.

*CUT*

E: It’s Riot for short.

D: Nice. So are you gonna keep your hair long?

E: Yeah. When my hair is short, I feel boring.

D: I see. So you’re saying that bald people are boring?

E: Well..

*CUT*

LR: Well.. Are you gonna spill the tea?

Ody: Hahaha, alright. My owner is an oddball. He is a Redditor.
He likes programming and whenever he accomplishes
something, he celebrates by dancing and screaming „WOOO“.
He finds literally any reason to smoke. But it’s nice to see him
happy. Doing what he finds fun. Enjoying life.

LR: My owner is a chill guy. He likes climbing, hiking, and is
doing a PhD as of this summer.

Ody: Damn.. My owner programs shitty apps.

LR: Hahaha, you're funny. So, how's his room?

Ody: Ah, I don’t even know where to start.

*CUT*

E: Ah, I don't even know where to start. I would use the laser
eyes as a lighter. I would fly everywhere.

D: That sounds awesome, man.

*CUT*

Ody: That sounds awesome, man. I h
ave never heard of Swing
Jazz.
LR: Haha, and you? Does your owner have a good music taste?

Ody: Limited, I’d say. He only listens to one song: Mr.
Brightside. Over and over.

*CUT*

E: Over and over. I just love baking scones. I feel so peaceful. I
also watched „Charlie and the Chocolate Factory“ while eating
chocolate cake.

D: I find that funny.

*CUT*

Ody: I find that funny. How is it that they're friends? They seem
completely different.

LR: Well, humans have a great variety of characteristics. People
get on well depending on the circumstances.

Ody: True.

LR: And if you think about it, we are also pretty different.

Ody: Oh, that's true!

LR: You are elegant and independent. You don't even need a
lighter. I’m just a One Hitter. Plain and boring.

Ody: Not at all! You look simple with a small hint of
sophistication and-

LR: Calm down, dude. I’m just joking. I have a healthy amount
of self-esteem. Haha, I don’t give a shit what people think of
me.

Ody: Oh, hahaha.

*CUT*

E: Hahaha. I would definitely jump. How about you?

D: Well, you can’t be sure, but I would stay and suffocate to
death. It would be an instant death to jump. If it was the last
sensation of my life, I would see things through, regardless of
the pain.

E: Damn…

*CUT*

Ody: I'd go clubbing. Oh, I’d go underwater cave diving. Mainly
activities, that produce an adrenaline rush.

LR: Dude, if I was a human, I’d live in the forest. I would hike
every day and enjoy nature.

Ody: Why? I find that funny, to be honest.

LR: I am made of wood. I used to be a tree. I can talk to trees.

Ody: Really?

LR: Yeah. My friends are still trees. We celebrated when the
lumberjacks announced that I’d become a pipe.

Ody: That is very interesting. What do trees talk about?

LR: Well, the usual. Politics and religion. Machiavelli. Submarines.

Ody: Awesome.

*CUT*

D: Awesome.

E: Did you also know, that birds have a divorce rate? A divorce
rate means if the birds find another partner in the next mating
season. On one hand, flamingos have a divorce rate of 99
percent, on the other hand, albatrosses have a divorce rate of 0
percent!

*CUT*

Ody: So have you met other bongs, pipes, or vapes?

LR: Just one. A small dark-blue bubbler with emerald-green and
ruby-red spots on it. Very beautiful. She was called Plotina.
Ody: Ah, beautiful name.

LR: She belonged to a widow. A sad story, actually. The former
owner, the man, was an avid smoker, but the woman had never
smoked. She hated the smell of cannabis. He would smoke on
his front porch just before the sunrise, which we always enjoyed.
When he died due to a tough battle with a rare blood disease, she
started smoking. She started to love the smell, because it gave
her the feeling that he was still around. She started smoking
every morning on her front porch and enjoyed the sunrise, while
talking to him as if he were there.

Ody: Dude, that is so heart-breaking. What a heart-breaking
story. Damn…

LR: Dude.. I’m fucking with you. I haven’t met anybody else
except you.

Ody: What?

LR: That was complete bullshit. I made all that up. My owner
barely smokes.

Ody: Man, you got me there.

LR: How about you? Met any others?

Ody: Just one. Named Midas.

*CUT*

E: A room full of space, that has a rustic feeling, and
minimalistic. I would wake up to warmth and the pleasant smell
of wood and coffee. It would be peaceful. I can start the day
however I want. That is all I want in life.

D: I want a.. garage fridge.

E: Oh come on. That can’t be it. When you close your eyes and
think about what you really want, what do you see?

D: Hmmm..

*DAYDREAMS*

D: I haven't consumed weed in 100 days! I feel so free and
strong. I never thought that it'd be possible to enjoy life without
marijuana.

*CUT TO ANOTHER DAYDREAM*

D: Let’s get sober!

*CUT TO ANOTHER DAYDREAM*

E: Dude I had an awesome therapy session. What are you doing
this weekend?

D: I’m gonna get sober as fuck and going to Cootes!

*CUT TO ANOTHER DAYDREAM*

D: It’s not a bad drug at all. It's me. I was dependent and I was
lying to myself.

*CUT TO ANOTHER DAYDREAM*

Random person: You were a drug addict, eh?

D: Still am. Just a sober one.

*END OF DAYDREAMS*

E: … Well?

D: I’m not ready to talk about it.

E: Alright. I respect that.

*CUT*

Ody: To be honest, it’s better to be a vape. Humans have so
many obligations. Humans have desire, which complicates
things. We only have one purpose.

LR: True. I find toes gross. I wouldn’t want that.

Ody: Exactly. And knees? Sometimes they look like ugly faces.

LR: Yeah, and bad breath. So gross.

Ody: Hahaha. We're lucky.

*CUT*

D: I know it’s late, but I have a surprise for you. For your
birthday!

E: What?

D: *clears throat*

E: You're gonna sing it, eh?

D: *still clearing throat*

E: Yeah, you're gonna sing it.

D: *sings schön dass du geboren bist*

E: Very beautiful. Thanks for that.

D: Hahaha. My pleasure. Do you want some dark chocolate?

E: Ah, I would kill for some dark chocolate.

D: Here you go.

*D, stoned out of his fucking mind, reaches his hand out to E
with a piece of dark chocolate and D looks at E, but he looks at
an empty chair instead. E was never there.*
