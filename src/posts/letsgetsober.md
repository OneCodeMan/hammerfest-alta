Beautiful wife. Beautiful children. \
You're fifty, life still runs. \
But your lungs are shot. \
CPAP won't save you. \
You want to play with them so bad. \
You force yourself, all your strength. \
Nope. \
You robbed yourself of this experience. \
Your lungs have endured too many bowls. \
Was it worth it? \
Obviously not. \
Idiot.
